# Style Standards

A presentation on Standards. More specifically focused on that part of code bases which contain the lovely language of CSS.

The talk is generic enough to be considered as a call for Standards from personal projects to those of companies. I appreciate comments and hope to fine tune the presentation to a point where it can be applicable for many years.

## About
